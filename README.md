# My Portfolio
I am interested in game development. Additionally, I want people to see my projects, so I am also practicing web development to create a website where I can showcase my games. This way, my website will also serve as a portfolio with links to my other social media.

## Here you can find
### Blocky
Simple 3D puzzle with orthographic camera. Made a video tutorial.
You're playing for a red rectangle that needs to be freed from this trap. But it's not that simple: in addition to you, there are other figures that move only vertically and horizontally. They make it much harder to get through, but don't forget the buttons that are great for activating and deactivating objects.

### Fall Balls
A small game in which you need to catch multi-colored balls so that they do not go out in eternal darkness. You play as a platform that can only move left and right. This time the game has a menu and a pause.
